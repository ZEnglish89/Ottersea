Hello Professor!

This is my project! Unfortunately, I wrote it in C++, which is a compiled language. That means that the executable file, `Ottersea.exe` cannot simply be run on your machine, as it was compiled on mine and our hardware environments are different. I'm so used to working with CS professors that I didn't even consider it could be an issue until it was too late.

It may be worth double-clicking on the file to confirm this, but unless we get exceptionally lucky it will not work.

If you, by any chance at all, have a C++ compiler installed, it would be relatively simple to recompile the executible. For example, with the g++ compiler, running the command "g++ main.cpp -o Ottersea.exe" would fix our problem immediately.

However, rather than expecting you to do that, I have recorded a video of me playing through the game and taking each possible path. It is both awkwardly long and awkwardly quiet, but hopefully it serves to get the point across.

This is definitely suboptimal!! If given the chance, I would love to present the game to you or Bailey in person.

As a side note, do feel free to go through the code as you wish! `main.cpp` contains the logic which the game runs on, and `scenes.h` contains the content, the actual words which appear on-screen.

My Apologies,

Hello Professor,

This is my project! I've taken a bit of a risk writing it in C++ rather than Python, given that I don't know how much computer science experience you have, and compiled languages can come with a bit of pain when moving from device to device.

*If everything goes well,* you should be able to double-click on "Ottersea.exe" and immediately begin playing! If everything is working, running the file will open a command window where the game is played, open to the main menu.

If the game does NOT run, then I'm in trouble. If by any chance you have a C++ compiler installed on any computer you own, navigating to my project's directory and running the command "g++ main.cpp -o Ottersea.exe" will recompile the code into a new version of the file, and fix the issue.

Otherwise, I'd have to rely on either recording a video of myself playing, or giving you an in-person demonstration, neither of which are as fun as letting you keep a playable file.

This may be overcautious of me, but I just wanted to cover all of my bases! I promise I spent a lot of time on this and it works, if there are technical issues I would love to help resolve them.

Also, feel free to browse the code as you please! `main.cpp` contains the logic off of which the game runs, while `scenes.h` contains the actual content of the game, the words written on-screen. Just be warned that the scenes had to be written entirely on one line each, which makes that file a bit of a headache to read.

Okay, I've taken up ENTIRELY too much of your time with all these words. The point is, thank you for your time, I hope all goes well, I hope you enjoy, and please do contact me if anything does NOT go well!
